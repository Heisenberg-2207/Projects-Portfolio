Hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian Optimization to maximize the reward function in various gridworld environments. The experiments compared the performance of the two algorithms across different world configurations, analyzing factors such as reward, number of steps to reach the goal, and state visitation frequency. The study provides insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of the softmax and epsilon-greedy policies under different conditions.

Dueling Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Monte Carlo (MC) Reinforce methods with and without baselines, applied to environments like Acrobot-v1 and CartPole-v1. The report includes sections on hyperparameter tuning, code implementation, and the use of Weights and Biases (WANDB) for optimization. Analysis of the results, discussing the performance and convergence of the algorithms under various configurations.
