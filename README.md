Using the given cricket analytics data, created new features using bowlers and baters dataset such as average wickets in last 10 games etc. used a stacked ensemble to join xgboost, lightboost and catboost. tuned the hyperparameters using optium

Finetuned a pretrained huggingface model on Airline Tweets dataset. Large language models (LLMs) are powerhouses of general language knowledge, but fine-tuning allows them to excel at specific tasks. It's like taking a language whiz and giving them specialized training in a particular field.

Analyze Ball and Player Motion with the help of Image Processing techniques for Sports Performance Insights
● Developed a ball tracking algorithm using OpenCV to monitor ball trajectory based on color, circularity, and area properties and detected speed, net clearance, bounce point, and racket hitting point of ball with an accuracy of 80%
● Employed frame differentiation and background segmentation techniques to track players during rallies and analyzed their motion patterns to gain player’s gameplay insights
